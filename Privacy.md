**Effective date:** January 4, 2026

Crosi (“we”, “us”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what we collect and how we use it.

## Information We Collect
- **Account info:** like your email and basic profile info (if you create an account).
- **Connected platform data:** when you connect YouTube/TikTok or other platforms, we receive tokens/permissions and limited account info needed to post on your behalf.
- **Content you submit:** videos, captions, thumbnails, and related metadata you choose to upload/post through Crosi.
- **Basic usage data:** like logs (IP address, device/browser info, timestamps) for security and debugging.

## How We Use Information
We use your information to:
- provide the service (connect accounts, upload/post content, manage your settings),
- keep the service secure and prevent abuse,
- troubleshoot issues and improve reliability,
- communicate with you about service updates or support.

## How We Share Information
- We share your content and required data **only with the platforms you choose to connect** (e.g., to upload a video).
- We may use service providers (hosting, analytics, error logging) to run Crosi.
- We may disclose information if required by law or to protect safety/security.

## Data Retention
We keep information as long as needed to provide the service and comply with legal/security needs. You can request deletion (see Contact).

## Your Choices
- You can disconnect a platform account at any time.
- You can request access or deletion of your data.

## Security
We use reasonable safeguards to protect your data, but no system is 100% secure.
