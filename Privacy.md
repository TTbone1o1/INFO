# Terms of Service (Crosi)

**Effective date:** [January 4, 2026]

By using **Crosi** (“we”, “us”), you agree to these Terms.

## What Crosi Does
Crosi helps you connect your social accounts and post content you choose to supported platforms (for example, YouTube, and others we add later). Crosi is not affiliated with or endorsed by any third-party platform.

## Your Content
You own your content. You give Crosi permission to store, process, and upload your content only to provide the service (for example, uploading to the platforms you connect).

You are responsible for your content and for following each platform’s rules and terms.

## Connected Accounts
If you connect a third-party account (like YouTube or TikTok), you authorize Crosi to access that account only for the permissions you approve during setup (scopes).

## Acceptable Use
Don’t use Crosi to break laws, violate rights, spam, or abuse the service.

## Changes / Availability
We may change or stop parts of the service at any time. The service is provided “as is” and “as available”.

## Termination
We may suspend or end access if you violate these Terms or if needed for safety/security/legal reasons.
